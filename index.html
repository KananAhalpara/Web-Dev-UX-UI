					<h2>Graphic Design Trends</h2>
					<h4>Louder and Brighter Colors</h4>
					<p>Now, in 2017, there will be a shift away from neutral colors like whites, grays and black, to bolder and brighter colors.
					Using bold color accents will also help many brands cling to their minimalist roots. By infusing bright colors with traditional neutral backgrounds, companies can give their branding a fresh new look without straying too far from what made them great.Actually, a lot of the things that will be trending in 2017 are influenced by the adoption of the Material Design principles.</p>
					<p>If you need some great examples of color palettes that fit this bold scheme, check out <a href="https://venngage.com/blog/infographic-design-the-dos-and-donts-of-color-selection/">this article </a>that helps you choose the best colors for your designs. Don’t be afraid to use colors that contrast starkly against one another. </p>

					<h2>Typography Trends</h2>
					<h4>Bolder Fonts</h4>
					<p>In 2017, bold typography will also fight against the ever-dwindling attention spans of readers, and the saturation of content. Big and daring fonts will be used to grab the eye.One of my favorite examples of this would have to be Wired. They use a mix of fonts to emphasize individual titles and establish a hierarchy of information on the page.</p>

					<p>Additionally, the shift to mobile and extremely high definition screens will also increase the need for bold fonts. Obviously, more and more people will be using their phones to get content, and the way that content is presented will need to keep up.We also took a similar approach, when creating this infographic template. Mixing bold font choices with interesting colors to create an eye-catching graphic.I have been using Google Fonts for a while now because they are so versatile. If I need to design one thing online and then add it to my slide deck, I am confident the fonts will work together. And they play nice with about every blog or site you could build.</p>
					
					<blockquote>Oh, and did I mention most of these 810 different fonts are free to use? Yeah, people like free. And they like things that are insanely easy to use.</blockquote>

					<h2>Vediography Trends</h2>
				 	<h4>Duotones and Animation In Action</h4>
					<p>Duotones are simply the combining of two colors on an image, usually using very bright or contrasting colors. They require a bit of design work but it is most definitely worth it.Everyone (well, almost everyone) loves GIFs. They are the perfect little conversation helper that expresses emotion when text won’t do the trick.Plus, they do not require any special software to run, usually have a small file size, and can be embedded just about anywhere.So they are better than videos and images, in most cases when loading time or data usage needs to be minimized. And I think that versatility is what will make them even better and more useful in 2017.</p>

				 	<h2>UX/UI Trends</h2>
				 	<h4>Minimalism Back To Its Roots</h4>
					<p>In 2017, that will all change. This is the year that minimalism, hopefully, gets its groove back. And that involves using a lot more color. Mobile devices are now just as powerful as computers and some even have better screens.One of my favorite minimalist-influenced designs would have to be Medium’s logo. They were able to include a bunch of different colors but still create a very minimalist logo.</p>
